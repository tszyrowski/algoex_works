Summing numbers
===============

Write a function that takes a non empty array of integers and a target sum.
Return numbers from the input array if any two of those numbers sum up to the target sum.
The no numbers sum up to the target return an empty array.
- Target sum should be obtained by summing two different elements in the array. 

Example:
```
>>> array = [12, 1, 3, 5, -2, -4, 8, 6]
>>> targetSum = 10
>>> numberSum(array, targetSum)
[-1, 11]
```
