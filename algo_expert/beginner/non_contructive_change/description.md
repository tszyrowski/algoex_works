**Non-Constructible Change**

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you *cannot* create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you're given `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is `4`. If you're given no coins, the minimum amount of change you can't create is `1`.

**Sample Input:**
``` 
coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
```

**Sample Output:**
```
20
```

Let’s walk through the problem-solving approach and look at a neat Python solution to help you develop a systematic approach to similar problems.

### Problem Understanding:

- You are given an array of **positive integers** representing the values of coins.
- Your task is to find the **minimum amount of change** (sum of money) that **cannot** be created with these coins.
  
For example:
- With `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, you can create the sums 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. The minimum sum you **cannot** create is 4.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sorting the Coins**: A key insight is that by sorting the coins, you can consider building up the smallest possible sums starting from 1. The idea is to start with the smallest coin and check if you can build up consecutive sums.
  
2. **Tracking the Maximum Constructible Change**: As you iterate over the sorted coins, keep track of the maximum amount of change you can construct so far. For each coin, you check:
   - If the coin is larger than the current "constructible" change + 1, then that means there is a gap, and you can’t create some amount of change.
   - Otherwise, you add the value of the coin to your running total of constructible change.

3. **Stopping Early**: The moment you encounter a coin that is larger than your current constructible change + 1, that’s the point where the "gap" appears, and you have found the minimum unconstructible change.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Sort the coins**.
2. **Iterate over the coins**, maintaining a running sum of the maximum change you can construct so far.
3. **Check for gaps** where you can’t construct a certain amount of change.

### Python Solution:

```python
def nonConstructibleChange(coins):
    """
    Returns the minimum amount of change that cannot be created using the coins.

    :param coins: List of positive integers representing coin values
    :return: Minimum amount of change that cannot be created
    """
    coins.sort()  # Sort the coins
    current_change = 0

    for coin in coins:
        # If the current coin is larger than the next possible change + 1,
        # then we can't construct that next change.
        if coin > current_change + 1:
            return current_change + 1
        
        current_change += coin  # Update the maximum constructible change so far

    # If all coins can construct consecutive sums, return current_change + 1
    return current_change + 1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
    result = nonConstructibleChange(coins)
    print(result)  # Expected output: 20
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the coins helps you process them from the smallest to largest. This ensures you always know whether or not you can build consecutive change.
  
2. **current_change**: This variable keeps track of the maximum amount of change that you can construct using the coins seen so far. For example:
   - If `current_change = 5`, it means that with the coins you've processed, you can construct all sums from `1` to `5` inclusive.
  
3. **Coin Check**: For each coin:
   - If the coin value is greater than `current_change + 1`, this means that there is a gap in the sums you can make, and the smallest unconstructible change is `current_change + 1`.
   - Otherwise, you add the coin value to `current_change`, expanding the range of constructible sums.

4. **Final Return**: If you manage to process all coins without finding a gap, the smallest unconstructible change will be `current_change + 1` (the next value).

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the coins takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of coins.
- The iteration through the coins takes **O(n)**.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

### Approach to Solving Similar Problems:

1. **Clarify the Problem**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. In this case, you’re looking for the smallest "gap" in the amounts of change that can be created.

2. **Look for Patterns**: In many coin and sum-related problems, sorting the values can reveal patterns. Once sorted, you can often build solutions by working with smaller values first and ensuring no gaps in possible sums.

3. **Use a Greedy Strategy**: A greedy strategy works well when you need to build something incrementally. Here, we always try to build up the smallest unconstructible change using the smallest coins first.

4. **Think in Terms of Invariants**: The key invariant in this problem is the "maximum change we can construct so far." Once this invariant is broken (i.e., we find a coin larger than `current_change + 1`), we know we’ve found the answer.
