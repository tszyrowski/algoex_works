**Transpose Matrix**

You’re given a 2D array of integers `matrix`. Write a function that returns the transpose of the matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right); it switches the row and column indices of the original matrix.

You can assume the input matrix always has at least 1 value; however its width and height are not necessarily the same.

### Sample Input #1
```
matrix = [
  [1, 2],
]
```

### Sample Output #1
```
[
  [1],
  [2]
]
```

### Sample Input #2
```
matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
  [5, 6]
]
```

### Sample Output #2
```
[
  [1, 3, 5],
  [2, 4, 6]
]
```

### Sample Input #3
```
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

### Sample Output #3
```
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]
```

## A:

Let's break down the issue with your current solution and how we can fix it.

### Problem Analysis:

- The transpose of a matrix swaps rows with columns. In this case, the matrix:
  ```
  [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6]
  ]
  ```
  should be transposed to:
  ```
  [
    [1, 3, 5],
    [2, 4, 6]
  ]
  ```
  
### Issue with Your Code:

1. **Initial `transpose` Structure**: You start with `transpose = [[],]`, which initializes the transpose as a list with a single empty list. This will cause an issue when trying to access `transpose[j][i]` because the inner lists are not initialized properly for each column.

2. **Out-of-Bounds Error**: When you try to access `transpose[j][i] = cell`, you're assuming that `transpose[j]` already exists, but since `transpose` is not correctly initialized, it will raise an **IndexError**.

### Approach:

- You need to initialize `transpose` as a list of empty lists, where the number of inner lists should equal the number of columns in the original matrix (i.e., the number of elements in each row). This allows you to properly assign values to `transpose[j][i]`.

### Solution:

Here’s an improved version of your code:

```python
def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    """
    Returns the transpose of the given 2D matrix.

    :param matrix: List of lists where each inner list is a row of the matrix
    :return: Transposed version of the matrix
    """
    # Initialize the transpose matrix with the right dimensions
    rows = len(matrix)
    cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Create a matrix with 'cols' rows and 'rows' columns, initialized with empty lists
    transpose = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]
    
    # Fill in the transpose by swapping rows and columns
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
    
    return transpose

if __name__ == "__main__":
    matrix = [
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4],
        [5, 6]
    ]
    t = transposeMatrix(matrix)
    print(t)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Initialize `transpose` with correct dimensions**: 
   ```python
   transpose = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]
   ```
   This creates a list of lists, where each inner list is a row in the transposed matrix, with enough slots (initialized to `0`) to hold the elements.

2. **Filling the Transposed Matrix**: 
   - We loop over the rows and columns of the original matrix.
   - For each element `matrix[i][j]`, we assign it to the transposed matrix as `transpose[j][i]`.

### Output for the Example:

For the input matrix:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6]
]
```

The output would be:
```
[
    [1, 3, 5],
    [2, 4, 6]
]
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. We iterate through each element of the matrix exactly once.

### Summary:

- **Key Concept**: The transpose of a matrix swaps rows and columns.
- **Initialization Issue**: You need to properly initialize the `transpose` matrix to avoid indexing errors.
- **Corrected Logic**: With the matrix initialized correctly, we can then use double loops to swap and assign the values accordingly.

This approach ensures that you properly transpose the matrix in an efficient and Pythonic way.

## Q:

I have other poroposals:

def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    return list(zip(*matrix))


def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    return [list(t) for t in list(zip(*matrix))] 

def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    res = [[] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
    for i in matrix:
        for idx, val in enumerate(i):
            res[idx].append(val)
    return res


cam you comment on it

## A:

Let’s go through each of your proposed solutions and comment on their functionality, efficiency, and Pythonic style:

### 1. Using `zip` (first proposal):
```python
def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    return list(zip(*matrix))
```

#### Explanation:
- **`zip(*matrix)`**: The `*` operator unpacks the matrix (i.e., turns rows into individual arguments to `zip`), and `zip` pairs up the corresponding elements from each row, effectively creating the transposed version.
- **`list(zip(*matrix))`**: This wraps the result of `zip` into a list, because `zip` returns an iterator (in Python 3).

#### Pros:
- **Concise**: This is a very short and Pythonic way to transpose a matrix.
- **Efficiency**: The time complexity is still `O(n * m)`, which is the best you can achieve for this problem.
- **Readability**: For experienced Python programmers, this is very readable. It leverages Python's built-in functions efficiently.

#### Cons:
- **Output Format**: `zip` produces tuples, so the result will be a list of tuples, not a list of lists. This might not always match the expected matrix structure (list of lists).
  
#### Suggested Improvement:
If you need the result as a list of lists (as in most cases with matrix manipulations), you can use the second proposal below.

---

### 2. Using `zip` but converting to lists (second proposal):
```python
def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    return [list(t) for t in list(zip(*matrix))]
```

#### Explanation:
- **`zip(*matrix)`**: Same as before, it transposes the matrix but returns tuples.
- **`[list(t) for t in list(zip(*matrix))]`**: This list comprehension converts each tuple returned by `zip` into a list, so that the final output is a list of lists.

#### Pros:
- **Concise and Readable**: This is still very concise and Pythonic, with just a minor adjustment from the first proposal to ensure the final output is a list of lists rather than a list of tuples.
- **Correct Output Format**: This now returns the result in the correct format (list of lists).

#### Cons:
- **Readability for Beginners**: While very Pythonic, the use of `zip` with unpacking (`*matrix`) may not be immediately intuitive to beginners.

#### Verdict:
This version is probably the best balance between **conciseness** and **correctness**. It’s both Pythonic and returns the correct format (list of lists). It's also optimal in terms of time and space complexity, so this is a great option.

---

### 3. Using a manual nested loop (third proposal):
```python
def transposeMatrix(matrix):
    res = [[] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
    for i in matrix:
        for idx, val in enumerate(i):
            res[idx].append(val)
    return res
```

#### Explanation:
- This solution manually creates the transposed matrix by iterating over the original matrix.
- **`res = [[] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]`**: Initializes an empty list for each column of the original matrix.
- **Nested loop**: The outer loop iterates through each row of the matrix, and the inner loop (`enumerate`) processes each element in the row, appending the value to the appropriate list in `res`.

#### Pros:
- **No external functions**: This is a purely manual solution that doesn’t rely on `zip` or other built-in functions, which might be useful for demonstrating your understanding of matrix manipulation.
- **Flexibility**: You have complete control over how the matrix is built.

#### Cons:
- **Less Pythonic**: While this solution works, it is more verbose than necessary. Python has built-in functions like `zip` that are better suited for this task and result in more concise and idiomatic code.
- **Readability**: It requires more lines of code than necessary, which could make it harder to read and maintain.
- **Potential inefficiency**: Although still `O(n * m)` in complexity, the use of nested loops makes this slightly less optimal than `zip` due to the explicit construction and appending operations.

#### Verdict:
This solution is good if you want to manually control the matrix transposition process, but it is less Pythonic and not as clean as the solutions using `zip`.

---

### Summary of Recommendations:

1. **First Proposal** (`list(zip(*matrix))`):
   - Very concise but returns a list of tuples. Use this if you're fine with tuples in the result.
   
2. **Second Proposal** (`[list(t) for t in zip(*matrix)]`):
   - The best balance between **conciseness** and **correctness**. It’s Pythonic and returns the transposed matrix as a list of lists, which is likely the expected output format in most cases.
   
3. **Third Proposal** (manual nested loop):
   - It’s a more verbose and less Pythonic solution, but it gives full control over the process. It’s not necessary unless you want to avoid `zip` and write the transposition logic from scratch.

If you're looking to write **neat** Python and optimize for readability and performance, I would recommend the **second proposal**. It’s the most Pythonic and efficient for this task.
